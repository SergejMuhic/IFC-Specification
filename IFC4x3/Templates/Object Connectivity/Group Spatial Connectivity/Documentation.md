the concept of Group Spatial Connectivity allows for the association of a _IfcGroup_ ( and its relevent subtypes) representing a grouping og objects to a particular spatial structure, either an entire facility (and its specific subtypes e.g. buildings, bridges, roads, or marine facilities), a facility part, a building storey, or any part of these structures.
The group (_IfcGroup_) in question should be human identifiable by its _Name_ attribute.
The relationship (_IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_) in question can provide context of the connection through the _Name_ and _Description_ attributes.
The use of _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ in this template provides the relationship across spatial and functional hierarchies allowing the spatial coverage of functional groups.
