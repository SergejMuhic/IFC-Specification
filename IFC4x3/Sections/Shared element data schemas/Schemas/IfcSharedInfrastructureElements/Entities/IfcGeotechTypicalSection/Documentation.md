Interval along the alignment/built structure with similar ground conditions, as part of the GeotechSynthesis model that represents the connection between the ground model and the built structure. Includes key-properties like expected distribution of ground types (reference to GeotechUnits) and baseline-definition of expected ground conditions and potential hazards, and may also include key-information on design like excavation measures, distribution of support types etc. These properties can be provided using pre- or user-defined property sets, using _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ or external datasets using _IFcRelAssociatesDataset_.
