A surface constructed by sweeping potentially varying open cross sections along a curve horizontally (or near horizontally). The surface is generated by sweeping the _CrossSections_ between _CrossSectionPositions_; linear interpolation is assumed, unless transitions curves between cross section points are indicated by OpenCrossProfileDef.Tags.

The profile normal is derived from the associated _IfcAxis2PlacementLinear_, not necessarily the tangent of the _Directrix_. The profile X axis is oriented perpendicularly to the left of the _Directrix_ (same direction as _RefDirection_ derived in _IfcAxis2PlacementLinear_) as facing forward along the directrix, and the profile Y axis is oriented upwards according to _Axis_ attribute of _IfcAxis2PlacementLinear_.

Figure 1 illustrates an _IfcSectionedSurface_ defined using _IfcOpenCrossProfileDef_

In case of branching longitudinal breaklines, the SectionedSurface may use OpenCrossProfileDef instances with varying number of cross section points. In that case, the point in two consecutive cross sections that are connected are identified by the same tag value.

**Informal Propositions:** No two consecutive sections shall intersect.
* If the directrix is not tangent continuous, the resulting surface is created by a miter at half angle between the two segments.
* Very sharp edges may result in nearly impossible miter; implementer agreements may define acceptable limits for tangent discontinuity or require the directrix to be tangent continuous.
* The directrix shall not intersect
